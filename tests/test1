Sets the file position indicator for the file stream stream to the value pointed to by offset.
If the stream is open in binary mode, the new position is exactly offset bytes measured from the beginning of the file if origin is SEEK_SET, from the current file position if origin is SEEK_CUR, and from the end of the file if origin is SEEK_END. Binary streams are not required to support SEEK_END, in particular if additional null bytes are output.
If the stream is open in text mode, the only supported values for offset are zero (which works with any origin) and a value returned by an earlier call to ftell on a stream associated with the same file (which only works with origin of SEEK_SET.
If the stream is wide-oriented, the restrictions of both text and binary streams apply (result of ftell is allowed with SEEK_SET and zero offset is allowed from SEEK_SET and SEEK_CUR, but not SEEK_END)
In addition to changing the file position indicator, fseek undoes the effects of ungetc and clears the end-of-file status, if applicable.
If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the stream (ferror) is set and the file position is unaffected
